        },
      ],

      name: "lib",
      isOpen: true,
      children: [
        { type: "file", name: "utils.ts" },
        { type: "file", name: "uploadthing.ts" },
        { type: "file", name: "uploadthing-ui-types.ts" },
        { type: "file", name: "uploadthing-ui-utils.ts" },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

      name: "stores",
      isOpen: true,
      children: [
        { type: "file", name: "button-uploadthing-store.ts" },

      name: "hooks",
      isOpen: true,
